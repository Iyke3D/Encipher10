README - Chugiapps Learning Limited - Encipher10 v1.0
======================================================
Encipher10 uses symmetric encryption to encrypt and decrypt your files. Encrypt files includig:

1) doc/docx (Microsoft Word Files)
2) pdf
3) png
4) jpg
5) txt
6) ppt (Microsoft PowerPoint Files)
7) xls/xlsx (Microsoft Excel Files)
8) accdb/mdb (Microsoft Access File Extension)
9) zip
10) Audio/Video Files etc.

Before using this program, it is absolutely important to:

1) Backup the files that you want to encrypt first - I will not be held responsible for any file encrypted

2) Do not close the program after a successful encrypting of a particular file. This ensures that the program
can continue to run in the background and therefore, will obtain the same key that was used to encrypt the file
for decrypting it. This is the most important to have in mind when using the program

3) More features will be added in the future

Enjoy.
