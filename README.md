# Encipher10  v1.0
<p>Encipher10  v1.0 uses a <strong>symmetric encryption </strong>technique to encrypt and decrypt files. 
At it's best, Encipher10 uses one key to encrypt and decrypt files on the system. 
It is completely written in python and currently supports windows operating system (other operating systems will be supported in the next version).
Users can encrypt and decrypt files including:

1) doc/docx (Microsoft Word Files)
2) pdf
3) png
4) jpg
5) txt
6) ppt (Microsoft PowerPoint Files)
7) xls/xlsx (Microsoft Excel Files)
8) accdb/mdb (Microsoft Access File Extension)
9) zip
10) Audio/Video Files etc.</br></br>

<b>WARNING</b>
Before using Encipher, it is absolutely important to:</br></br>

1) <strong>Backup</strong> the files that you want to encrypt first - I will not be held responsible for any file encrypted

2) <strong>Do not close the program after a successful encrypting of a particular file</strong>. This ensures that the program
can continue to run in the background and therefore, will obtain the same key that was used to encrypt the file
for decrypting it. This is the most important to have in mind when using the program

3) More features will be added in the future</br></br>
